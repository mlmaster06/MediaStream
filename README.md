## Youtube Android Clone ðŸš€
This app consumes The Youtube Api to fetch and display a list of popular videos, The app uses MVVM design pattern to allow separation of the app components like fragments & activities from the data logic, some of the benefits are:
* Make the data survive device configuration changes
* Allow easier testing of different components in the app
* Also it's easier to maintain and scale the app over time

## Prerequisite
* To run the app successfully you need to create your own Google API KEY
* Navigate to the `com.breens.youtubeclone.util.Constants.kt` file and put your own api key
``
